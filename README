        Tumblr API + Google Maps API + Javascript + HTML5

## Quickly create travel logs using tumblr. Simply add a tag with a valid
## Google location (might want to double check it first) like  so :

        address Market and Second St. San Francisco CA

## All posts contained in your api feed that have 'address' tags will
## automatically appear on the gmap with marker and corresponding
## infowindow /eventlistener.


## Only one info window appears on screen. Addresses are also used for the marker titles.


## Images will be (by default) added to an info window. And data
## Appended to the specified div.
## Function build_gmap_marker() is very cool


## Swap out the first two scripts with urls that point to your data
## (tumblr feed & google api key)


## Use function special_tag_search() to parse your own custom 'special'
## tags.

## Reads any tumblr feed, detects tags beginning with 'address' to
## use googleapi

## Only supports photo posts for now! Advancements forthcoming...
